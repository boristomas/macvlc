Radio should sense how noisy channel is, example, i am the radio and i can sense that there 
is a lot of Sun radiation blinding my photosensor so i am willingly giving up my time of channel. Also,
can we use orientation and time of day to predict Sun radiation and eventually compensate somehow, 
using relay nodes on upper layers? Use joint power of multiple nodes (vehicles) to send message to
vehicle blinded by Sun?
 
---------------------------------------------
A sends to broadcast (-1)
B is broadcast member.
msg Tx, Rx list is unassigned
on transmit assign msg Tx list to all Tx from A
on receive assign ms Rx list to all Rx fom B
cantalk check is done on receieve side.
after cantalk msg lists contain only sensors that can talk to any other sensor on the other side
---------------------------------------------
A sends to B (direct)
A and B have each 4Tx and 4Rx
A and B do not have assigned Rx or Tx lists for msg to be sent
on transmit assign msg Tx list to all Tx from A
on transmit assign msg Rx list to all Rx from B
cantalk check is done on receieve side.
after cantalk msg lists contain only sensors that can talk to any other sensor on the other side
--------------------------------------------- 
for MAC implementation:
keep the sensors in pair, if something is received on only sid 1 then consider it received on complementary sensor (3).
example: both front will receive message. This is necessary to use only one radio for front side (and second for the rear)
