---------------------------------------------
A sends to broadcast (-1)
B is broadcast member.
msg Tx, Rx list is unassigned
on transmit assign msg Tx list to all Tx from A
on receive assign ms Rx list to all Rx fom B
cantalk check is done on receieve side.
after cantalk msg lists contain only sensors that can talk to any other sensor on the other side
---------------------------------------------
A sends to B (direct)
A and B have each 4Tx and 4Rx
A and B do not have assigned Rx or Tx lists for msg to be sent
on transmit assign msg Tx list to all Tx from A
on transmit assign msg Rx list to all Rx from B
cantalk check is done on receieve side.
after cantalk msg lists contain only sensors that can talk to any other sensor on the other side
--------------------------------------------- 
for MAC implementation:
keep the sensors in pair, if something is received on only sid 1 then consider it received on complementary sensor (3).
example: both front will receive message. This is necessary to use only one radio for front side (and second for the rear)
