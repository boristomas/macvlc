General coding and style guidelines for JiST/SWANS:

- Indentation is always exactly two spaces.
- Tabs should be completely avoided.
- Braces are on either own lines, as in:
    if(flag)
    {
      do_something();
    }
    else
    {
      do_something();
    }
- For single-statement code blocks, the following is to be avoided:
    if(flag)
      do_something();
  If you should instead use one of:
    if(flag)
    {
      do_something();
    }
  or:
    if(flag) do_something();
- Avoid file explosion by placing multiple related classes in the same file.
  One can use PUBLIC STATIC inner classes to achieve this without compromising
  class visibility or scope.
- Files that are related should share a prefix (not a suffix), as in:
    RadioNoiseIndep
    RadioNoiseAdditive
  rather than:
    IndepRadioNoise
    AdditiveRadioNoise
- Try to keep functions short, clear, and sensibly named. 
- Factor out common functionality wherever you possibly can.
- As rules of thumb, functions should preferably be:
   1) less than a screenful
   2) not indented beyond 3 levels
- Comment!
